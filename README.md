# Mini Trello App

**Mini Trello App** is a sample project implementing a Trello-like kanban board, using Firebase for the backend and a web frontend. The backend logic is implemented as **Firebase Cloud Functions** (serverless JavaScript). The frontend is a single-page web app served on **Firebase Hosting**, which provides fast, secure hosting for static sites. Data is stored in **Cloud Firestore**, a scalable NoSQL cloud database.

## Project Structure

- **functions/** – Node.js source for Firebase Cloud Functions (the backend API). These functions run on Firebase infrastructure.  
- **web/** – Frontend application source (likely a React app) to be built/served on Firebase Hosting.  
- **public/** – Static assets and the hosting root (e.g. `index.html`, images). This folder is configured as the Firebase Hosting public directory in `firebase.json`.  
- **firebase.json** – Firebase configuration (specifies Hosting, Functions, Firestore rules, etc.).  
- **firestore.rules** & **firestore.indexes.json** – Firestore security rules and index definitions for the Cloud Firestore database.  
- **.github/workflows/** – CI/CD workflow files (not needed for local development).  
- **.firebase/** – Local Firebase CLI state (generated by `firebase emulators` or `firebase init`, not manually modified).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or newer): Ensure Node and npm are installed. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  
- **Git** (optional): For cloning the repository.  
- **Firebase CLI**: Install with `npm install -g firebase-tools`. The Firebase CLI is used to run local emulators and deploy the app.  
- (Optional) **Yarn**: If you prefer Yarn over npm, you can use it for installing packages.

## Running the Backend (Cloud Functions)

1. **Install dependencies:** Open a terminal, navigate to the `functions` folder, and install packages:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```
2. **Build (if needed):** If the functions are written in TypeScript, build them (e.g. `npm run build`). If they are pure JavaScript, skip this step.
3. **Start Firebase emulators:** Go back to the project root and run the Firebase emulators to serve functions and Firestore locally:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

## Running the Frontend

1. **Install dependencies:** In a new terminal window, navigate to the `web` folder and install its packages:
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the dev server:** Run the frontend’s development server:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   This will compile and launch the web app on a localhost port (commonly `http://localhost:3000`).
3. **View the app:** Open your browser and go to the URL shown. The web app should load and connect to the emulated backend.

You can now use the Mini Trello UI and it will read/write data via the local Firestore and Functions emulators. To stop the servers, press **Ctrl+C** in each terminal.
